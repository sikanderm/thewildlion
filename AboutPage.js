            <p>Our goal is to be a resource of information on different lions around the world.
                    There are communities of lion enthusiasts on many social media platforms on 
                    the internet and this is just another easily accessible resource of information 
                    for those communities. We would like to help the efforts to save species like 
                    lions from going extinct by making their stories reach a bigger audience.</p>
